1) clustered_archive
	Initial clustering attempt. 3 clusters across time in shape and gene. Individual files containing variable cluster numbers at specific times.

2) clustered_filtered
	Redid ATML filtering and clustered with variable cluster number across time according to development of cell types.

3) clustered_new_mesh
	Repeated filtered clustering with the new mesh that was used to calculate curvature.

4) clustered_on_reduced
	 New mesh clustering on reduced features (PC1 and PC2) rather than all.
